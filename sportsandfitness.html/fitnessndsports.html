                        The term "yoga" in the Western world often denotes a modern form of Hatha yoga and a
                        posture-based physical fitness, stress-relief and relaxation technique,consisting largely of
                        asanas; this differs from traditional yoga, which focuses on meditation and release from worldly
                        attachments. It was introduced by gurus from India after the success of Swami Vivekananda's
                        adaptation of yoga without asanas in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.Vivekananda
                        introduced the Yoga Sutras to the West, and they became prominent after the 20th-century success
                        of hatha yoga.
                        Yoga-like practices are first mentioned in the Rigveda.Yoga is referred to in a number of the
                        Upanishads.The first known appearance of the word "yoga" with the same meaning as the modern
                        term is in the Katha Upanishad,which was probably composed between the fifth and third centuries
                        BCE.The most comprehensive text on Yoga, the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, date to the early
                        centuries of the Common Era.Yoga philosophy became known as one of the six orthodox
                        philosophical schools of Hinduism in the second half of the first millennium CE. Hatha yoga
                        texts began to emerge between the ninth and 11th centuries, originating in tantra.

                        Athletics is a group of sporting events that involves competitive running, jumping, throwing,
                        and walking.The most common types of athletics competitions are track and field, road running,
                        cross country running, and racewalking.<br>
                        The results of racing events are decided by finishing position, while the jumps and throws are
                        won by the athlete that achieves the highest or furthest measurement from a series of attempts.
                        The simplicity of the competitions, and the lack of a need for expensive equipment, makes
                        athletics one of the most common types of sports in the world. Athletics is mostly an individual
                        sport, with the exception of relay races and competitions which combine athletes' performances
                        for a team score, such as cross country.
                        <br>
                        Organized athletics are traced back to the Ancient Olympic Games from 776 BC. The rules and
                        format of the modern events in athletics were defined in Western Europe and North America in the
                        19th and early 20th century, and were then spread to other parts of the world. Most modern top
                        level meetings are held under the auspices of World Athletics, the global governing body for the
                        sport of athletics, or its member continental and national federations.

                        Swimming is an individual or team racing sport that requires the use of one's entire body to
                        move through water. The sport takes place in pools or open water (e.g., in a sea or lake).
                        Competitive swimming is one of the most popular Olympic sports, with varied distance events in
                        butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, freestyle, and individual medley. In addition to these
                        individual events, four swimmers can take part in either a freestyle or medley relay. A medley
                        relay consists of four swimmers who will each swim a different stroke, ordered as backstroke,
                        breaststroke, butterfly and freestyle.<br>
                        Swimming each stroke requires a set of specific techniques; in competition, there are distinct
                        regulations concerning the acceptable form for each individual stroke.There are also regulations
                        on what types of swimsuits, caps, jewelry and injury tape that are allowed at
                        competitions.Although it is possible for competitive swimmers to incur several injuries from the
                        sport, such as tendinitis in the shoulders or knees, there are also multiple health benefits
                        associated with the sport.

                        strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into
                        the opponent's court. The object of the game is to manoeuvre the ball in such a way that the
                        opponent is not able to play a valid return. The player who is unable to return the ball validly
                        will not gain a point, while the opposite player will. <br>
                        Tennis is an Olympic sport and is played at all levels of society and at all ages. The sport can
                        be played by anyone who can hold a racket, including wheelchair users. The original forms of
                        tennis developed in France during the late Middle Ages.The modern form of tennis originated in
                        Birmingham, England, in the late 19th century as lawn tennis. It had close connections both to
                        various field (lawn) games such as croquet and bowls as well as to the older racket sport today
                        called real tennis.<br>
                        The rules of modern tennis have changed little since the 1890s. Two exceptions are that until
                        1961 the server had to keep one foot on the ground at all times, and the adoption of the
                        tiebreak in the 1970s.A recent addition to professional tennis has been the adoption of
                        electronic review technology coupled with a point-challenge system, which allows a player to
                        contest the line call of a point, a system known as Hawk-Eye.

                        <h1 class="hh2"> Badminton </h1>
                        Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although
                        it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with one
                        player per side) and "doubles" (with two players per side). Badminton is often played as a
                        casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor
                        court. Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the
                        other team's half of the court.


                        The shuttlecock is a feathered or plastic projectile that flies differently from the balls used
                        in many other sports. In particular, the feathers create much higher drag, causing the
                        shuttlecock to decelerate more rapidly. Shuttlecocks also have a high top speed compared to the
                        balls in other racquet sports. The flight of the shuttlecock gives the sport its distinctive
                        nature.
                        <br>
                        The game developed in British India from the earlier game of battledore and shuttlecock.
                        European play came to be dominated by Denmark but the game has become very popular in Asia, with
                        recent competitions dominated by China. In 1992, badminton debuted as a Summer Olympic sport
                        with four events: men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, and women's doubles; mixed
                        doubles was added four years later. At high levels of play, the sport demands excellent fitness:
                        players require aerobic stamina, agility, strength, speed, and precision. It is also a technical
                        sport, requiring good motor coordination and the development of sophisticated racquet movements.

                        <h1 class="hh2"> Football </h1>
                        Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a
                        goal. Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is the most
                        popular where the word is used. Sports commonly called football include association football
                        (known as soccer in North America, Ireland and Australia); gridiron football (specifically
                        American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football; rugby union and rugby
                        league; and Gaelic football.These various forms of football share to varying extents common
                        origins and are known as "football codes". <br>
                        There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in
                        many different parts of the world.Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the
                        codification of these games at English public schools during the 19th century.The expansion and
                        cultural influence of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of
                        British influence outside the directly controlled Empire.By the end of the 19th century,
                        distinct regional codes were already developing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately
                        incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage.
                        In 1888, The Football League was founded in England, becoming the first of many professional
                        football associations. During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of football grew to
                        become some of the most popular team sports in the world.

                        <h1 class="hh2"> Cricket </h1>
                        Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the
                        centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two
                        bails balanced on three stumps. The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at one
                        of the wickets with the bat and then running between the wickets, while the bowling and fielding
                        side tries to prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball
                        to either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal include being
                        bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either
                        catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket
                        with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket. When ten batters have
                        been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two
                        umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches. They communicate
                        with two off-field scorers who record the match's statistical information.<br>

                        The earliest reference to cricket is in South East England in the mid-16th century. It spread
                        globally with the expansion of the British Empire, with the first international matches in the
                        second half of the 19th century. The game's governing body is the International Cricket Council
                        (ICC), which has over 100 members, twelve of which are full members who play Test matches. The
                        game's rules, the Laws of Cricket, are maintained by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London.
                        The sport is followed primarily in South Asia, Australasia, the United Kingdom, Southern Africa
                        and the West Indies.
